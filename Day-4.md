- The largest issue with both the mobile and desktop site is image size. This can be corrected by using webp instead of png.




## Performance

- The site seems to perform well yet there is an issue with the nav bar color changer running more slowly in relation. This could be corrected by cleaning up the javascript perhaps?

## Network

- I don't see much information here to draw from. 





## Summary

- I Feel more comfortable with knowing the lighthouse is a part of devtools. Being able to see how different parts of the site are behaving will help in streamlining.
